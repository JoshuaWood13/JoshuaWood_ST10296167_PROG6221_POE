How to compile and run the software:

# Make sure you have the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE installed! #

1. Right click on the project zip file and select extract all and then choose a location to extract to.

2. Open Microsoft Visual Studio and under "get started" select "Open a project or solution".

3. Navigate to find the location where you stored the extracted project zip file.

4. Inside the project folder you will find a solution file titled: "JoshuaWood_ST10296167_PROG6221_POE.sln". Run this solution file.

5. The project should now open inside of Visual Studio. In order to compile and run the software, go to the navigation bar located at the top of the IDE. There you will find a green play button titled "Start". Click on this play button and the software will compile and run, opening a Terminal window.

6. The application can be exited by user input, but in case of an error, it can also be exited by closing the window or pressing the red "Stop debugging" icon in the IDE navigation bar.
